                    You can make a simple yet attractive temperature converter website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a next step.
                    It will involve validation of the user input, using the dropdown menu to know if the input is celsius or Fahrenheit. 
                    You can add more functionality to it.

                    After building a complete restaurant website by yourself, you should now be confident in your skills. However, Practice makes Perfect.
                    In the next step, you must try making your own portfolio website for yourself. Showcase your projects, your social media handles, your experience on the website. You can refer to some templates available for free on Google for that.

                <p>Let’s make another responsive website and add it to our portfolio. A blog website is the one where users can add a new blog, edit it and view other blogs published on the platform.

                    At first glance, it may feel that we will have to use some kind of database for storing the blogs. However, it’s not the case. Using LocalStorage you can store the data with no expiration date, even when the browser is closed. Alternatively, you can use the database for storing the blogs.
                    
                    That means it will be available even when you close the browser and come back to the page.</p>
